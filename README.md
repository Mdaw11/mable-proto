Mable includes several key features that make it a powerful tool for managing your development projects. These features include:

Multiple user roles: Mable allows you to create and manage different user roles with varying levels of permissions, including admin, developer, and project manager. This ensures that each user can only access the features and data they need to do their job.


Projects and tickets: With Mable, you can create and manage projects, and track progress using tickets. Each ticket can be assigned to a specific user, and is connected to a project. You can also add comments, attachments, and labels to tickets for better organization.

Notifications: Mable provides real-time notifications for updates on tickets you're assigned to, so you can stay on top of issues and tasks without having to constantly check the web app.

Customizable templates: Depending on their user role, each user will have access to different templates to create, read, update, and delete projects and tickets. This allows users to focus on the tasks and information that are most relevant to them.

Overall, Mable is a user-friendly and efficient bug tracker web application that can help you streamline your development projects, prioritize tasks, and manage issues with ease.
